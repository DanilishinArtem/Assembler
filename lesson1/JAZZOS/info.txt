we have two things in operating systems:
    1. bootloader - it gathers info about system (for example info about hardware)
    2. kernel makes a real stuff with system (makes system calls and so on)

qemu-system-i386 -fda build/main.img - load OS from floppy disk
qemu-system-i386 -hda build/main.img - load OS from hard disk
qemu-system-i386 -hda build/main.img -s -S - load OS from hard disk in debug mode
